	  <h2>Watch Star Trek with some people</h2>
	  <p>
		Every Monday during term, we meet up and watch two episodes of
		Star Trek. That's basically all this society was set up to
		do. If that sounds like the kind of thing you're interested
		in, why not <a href="/involved.html">come along to a
		meeting</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Everyone is welcome!</h2>
	  <p>
		We're not a University society (although members do
		occasionally book college rooms for meetings). This means we
		can accept all sorts of people: students, non-students,
		members of the university, non-members, human, non-human, the
		list goes on. Whoever you are, you're welcome to turn up and
		watch some Trek with us.
