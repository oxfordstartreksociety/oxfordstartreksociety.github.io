		  Each week there is a poll on the Facebook group, where any
		  member can suggest an episode and vote for the two episodes
		  they'd like to see. The suggestions should follow the theme
		  the captain sets, but this isn't enforced. This isn't a
		  society with rules, really: if you really want to see an
		  episode and it loses the vote, we still might watch it. Like
		  if Threshold or Sub Rosa wins...
